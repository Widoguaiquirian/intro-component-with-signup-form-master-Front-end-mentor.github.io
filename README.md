Your users should be able to:

-  View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
-  See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
-  Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
   -  Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
   -  The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_
